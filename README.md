# Analysing Twitter during the Ukraine-Russia conflict
This repository contains a project made during the Spring Semester 2022 at the University of Fribourg, for the *Social Media Analytics* course. The goal was to perform a community detection on Twitter networks containing users (nodes) linked to other each other if they liked or retweeted a tweet (edges). The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-m-rows).

*Pipfile* and *Pipfile.lock* files are given to reproduce the experiments and run the code. One can install all needed dependencies by using the `pipenv install` command.

To run the *Jupyter Notebooks*, the command `pipenv run jupyter notebook` can be used.
